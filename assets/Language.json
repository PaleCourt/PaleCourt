      "RR_OGRIM_FIRST_1_1": "Little one! How nice to see you in these hallowed halls as a friend. Our sparring was truly enjoyable, but I do tire of it sometimes.",
      "RR_OGRIM_FIRST_1_2": "Yet, fighting you alongside Isma was a wonderful experience. We've worked on our techniques for some time now, and it was nice to try them against a new foe.",
      "RR_OGRIM_FIRST_1_3": "And you dodged them admirably! Fair warning friend: next time we won't make it any easier, haha!",
      "RR_OGRIM_FIRST_2_1": "Strong, swift, and analytical; watching Isma fighting is like witnessing a force of nature, is it not?",
      "RR_OGRIM_FIRST_2_2": "I'm sure you've been impressed yourself like everyone here! Plants commanded at will is not a thing you see ordinarily, let alone in battle. What wit and skill must be needed to manage such a thing...",
      "RR_OGRIM_FIRST_2_3": "I may... admire her more than I should, but none can state her strength is not impressive to behold! Through her kindness, we've learned much together, and that is the source of our synergy!",
      "RR_OGRIM_FIRST_REPEAT": "Have some rest now, you deserve it! Feel free to talk to the others in the meantime.",
      "RR_OGRIM_FIRST_DREAM": "Such strength... You are quite the curious fellow, little knight.",
      "RR_OGRIM_SECOND_1_1": "It's so refreshing to battle for the sake of teaching in these dire times, especially in an arena that allows room for creativity. What a blessing to be able to express our finest styles like this, really.",
      "RR_OGRIM_SECOND_1_2": "What would this trial be without dung to dive into, soil to grow on? And with civilians in danger from Hegemol's blows? Certainly not a good prospect, especially after that incident in the capital...",
      "RR_OGRIM_SECOND_1_3": "At least only the architecture suffered lasting damage.",
      "RR_OGRIM_SECOND_2_1": "Have you seen the gardens hidden here? Our Queen has grown several of them in the palace grounds, behind pale halls and pristine rooms. It's the perfect place to ease your nerves after a trying shift.",
      "RR_OGRIM_SECOND_2_2": "Isma told me she would love to create her own garden in her place. I wonder if the plants will survive with the very little light that comes through the waterways' pipes.",
      "RR_OGRIM_SECOND_2_3": "If they do, though, I would love to have some myself! She could teach me how to take care of them!",
      "RR_OGRIM_SECOND_REPEAT": "Either way, you seem to be learning fast. With such pace you'll surpass everyone in no time!",
      "RR_OGRIM_SECOND_DREAM": "Can it get even better...?",
      "RR_OGRIM_THIRD_1_1": "Your skills are astounding! It's a luck you're on our side, or it would've been trouble for us.",
      "RR_OGRIM_THIRD_1_2": "I can't wait to see you again in battle!",
      "RR_OGRIM_THIRD_REPEAT": "I can't wait to see you again in battle!",
      "RR_OGRIM_THIRD_DREAM": "The King was right, it will save Hallownest...",
      "RR_OGRIM_CHARM_1": "So, you bear my gift! Its loyal aura suits you so nicely that I thought it was your own heroic aroma!",
      "RR_OGRIM_CHARM_2": "This is a charm created with much care and caution, bestowed to me by our dear King as I've proven my loyalty to Him.",
      "RR_OGRIM_CHARM_3": "Your skill and honour have proven you worthy to wear my crest. It will serve you well, you have my esteem, friend!",
      "RR_OGRIM_CHEATER": "Begone! We don't tolerate cheaters or save editors on these grounds. That, or you're using the placeholder NPC.",
      "RR_ISMA_FIRST_1_1": "Ahh, so wonderful to talk with the mysterious little knight at last! I've not seen many who have this skill at wielding a nail. Besides our Dryya, of course!",
      "RR_ISMA_FIRST_1_2": "Was it the King who trained you? I've not seen our Liege ever hold a weapon, but his prowess in combat really must be great to have helped Him form a Kingdom so wondrous.",
      "RR_ISMA_FIRST_1_3": "I wonder what thought came to that red warrior's mind to so foolishly attempt the life of a wyrm...? I feel sorry for that dead traitor.",
      "RR_ISMA_FIRST_2_1": "Seeing Ogrim duelling with you, I just had to jump in before my proper turn! Apologies if I caused a scare!",
      "RR_ISMA_FIRST_2_2": "You seemed like a fun opponent to fight against! And we'd been itching to try out our special technique, anyway. Nothing quite like fighting with your... friend.",
      "RR_ISMA_FIRST_2_3": "Not that anything is happening between Ogrim and I. No, nothing at all. You mustn't worry about these trivial matters. Focus on your training instead! I understand you've a role to fulfil in our kingdom.",
      "RR_ISMA_FIRST_REPEAT": "Now go! It wouldn't do to keep you to myself when I'm sure the others would love to talk.",
      "RR_ISMA_FIRST_DREAM": "A curious one, to be certain... What secrets did the King keep to raise such strength...?",
      "RR_ISMA_SECOND_1_1": "You seem to have grown more accustomed to our movements, especially in an arena so unconventional.",
      "RR_ISMA_SECOND_1_2": "Fighting is even more fun in an environment of our liking, right? Luckily, our Monarch allows us room just for sparring.",
      "RR_ISMA_SECOND_1_3": "Dung, thorns, and flowers... Isn't it more pleasing to the eye than mere whiteness? Our King sure doesn't seem to mind the stench, somehow!",
      "RR_ISMA_SECOND_2_1": "Have you noticed those white blooms as Ze'mer joins the fight? I don't believe to have ever seen a plant so brittle and yet so fast to spread.",
      "RR_ISMA_SECOND_2_2": "There is an aura about them I cannot quite place that seems to influence Ze'mer in some form. Maybe it is the reason for the Queen's... no, not distaste, rather... prudence?",
      "RR_ISMA_SECOND_2_3": "Nonetheless, it's a joy to watch greenery grow on a battlefield.",
      "RR_ISMA_SECOND_REPEAT": "Let us meet in combat once again!",
      "RR_ISMA_SECOND_DREAM": "A fearsome knight it could become, with enough training and time...",
      "RR_ISMA_THIRD_1_1": "Another victory for you! I must thank you, for all of us Knights have improved in combat through our duels.",
      "RR_ISMA_THIRD_1_2": "I expect to see you again soon!",
      "RR_ISMA_THIRD_REPEAT": "I expect to see you again soon!",
      "RR_ISMA_THIRD_DREAM": "A pale aura, that of the King's...",
      "RR_ISMA_CHARM_1": "Ah, you must be wearing Ogrim's brooch! The smell was so indistinguishable from his that I thought it to be my imagination.",
      "RR_ISMA_CHARM_2": "He must've deemed you worthy to entrust you with such a dear gift and I can see the reason by how valiantly you fought.",
      "RR_ISMA_CHARM_3": "Take good care of it since I, too, hold it dear. I hope it serves you well.",
      "RR_ISMA_CHEATER": "Begone! We don't tolerate cheaters or save editors on these grounds. That, or you're using the placeholder NPC.",
      "RR_DRYYA_FIRST_1_1": "Oh, it's you. You may enter.",
      "RR_DRYYA_FIRST_1_2": "I have done my best to remain alert since news of that... infection came to us. Though it is a knight's duty to protect the kingdom's citizens, it has been difficult, especially against a peril neither seen nor felt.",
      "RR_DRYYA_FIRST_1_3": "Afflicted bugs will attack others without restraint, even those they are familiar with; many do not have the strength to turn their nail against the infected.",
      "RR_DRYYA_FIRST_1_4": "But I reckon you needn't worry about that, as the King tells us of an emptiness you possess that renders you immune to its effects.",
      "RR_DRYYA_FIRST_2_1": "Your combative skills are excellent. I haven't felt so exhilarated in a nail-fight for quite some time. Though Hegemol boasts about his size and blows, his bulk leaves him vulnerable. Don't tell him I ever said that, though.",
      "RR_DRYYA_FIRST_2_2": "Isma rather relies on her swiftness to scatter her plants all about, distracting her enemies before striking herself. Ogrim too, seems to be imitating her techniques through his... projectiles.",
      "RR_DRYYA_FIRST_2_3": "My style matches yours the most, and yet I couldn't seem to land a decisive strike on you. A challenging opponent for sure, with strength rivalling mine and Ze'mer's.",
      "RR_DRYYA_FIRST_2_4": "Perhaps you'll surpass all of us, one day. Or might it be too soon to tell?",
      "RR_DRYYA_FIRST_REPEAT": "I must focus on my duties now. Perhaps we may speak another time.",
      "RR_DRYYA_FIRST_DREAM": "To love, to care... Are these not needed to save our dear kingdom?",
      "RR_DRYYA_SECOND_1_1": "Your well-rounded style is to be envied, formidable for a grub such as yourself. And to perform it not just once, but twice...",
      "RR_DRYYA_SECOND_1_2": "I wonder, what will happen when you grow larger? It'd be a shame if you were to lose your mobility with age, however predictable...",
      "RR_DRYYA_SECOND_1_3": "Perhaps Ze'mer could teach you how she moves so quickly, despite her stature. None of us could ever properly learn it, but you seem different...",
      "RR_DRYYA_SECOND_2_1": "Sharpening the nail is an art, you know. If you've ever any need to polish that weapon of yours, I'll gladly help.",
      "RR_DRYYA_SECOND_2_2": "It seems your nail, too, has been forged from Pale Ore. Mine came from the Kingdom's Crown, where few have ventured before.",
      "RR_DRYYA_SECOND_2_2_ALT": "This nail of mine has been forged from pure Pale Ore. It came from the Kingdom's Crown, where few have ventured before.",
      "RR_DRYYA_SECOND_2_3": "I'm grateful that I was so easily able to obtain the ore that most nailsmiths are vying for. Mine was but a chunk, brought from the kingdom's peaks. Their mining's hardly done, so I'm sure some traveller would be happy to discover the rest.",
      "RR_DRYYA_SECOND_2_3_ALT": "I'm grateful that I was so easily able to obtain an ore that most nailsmiths squabble over. There had been more embedded in the stone of the peak, so perhaps it would be of use for your old blade.",
      "RR_DRYYA_SECOND_REPEAT": "I'll remain on guard for now, then. I'm sure the others have much to say to you.",
      "RR_DRYYA_SECOND_DREAM": "Its nail emanates a royal aura... A master nailsmith must certainly have participated in its creation...",
      "RR_DRYYA_THIRD_1_1": "Seems I've met my match in a nail-fight. My offer to sharpen your nail may not even be necessary, should you continue to handle it with that dexterity.",
      "RR_DRYYA_THIRD_1_2": "I expect I'll see you in the arena soon enough.",
      "RR_DRYYA_THIRD_REPEAT": "I expect I'll see you in the arena soon enough.",
      "RR_DRYYA_THIRD_DREAM": "My Queen worries... but perhaps it can face the infection unscathed?",
      "RR_DRYYA_CHARM_1": "I've noticed your relentless chains of swings in the trial. Our long training seems to have been fruitful and brought you to swift victory.",
      "RR_DRYYA_CHARM_2": "You have mastered the technique to the point of making it your own. I must laud you for this.",
      "RR_DRYYA_CHARM_3": "Remember: do not ever let go of the foe once you reach it; if you do not give them a break, they won't be able to fight back.",
      "RR_DRYYA_OLDNAIL_1": "...Ought I be offended or impressed that you bested me with a nail so worn? Never have I seen an instrument in a state of such disrepair.",
      "RR_DRYYA_OLDNAIL_2": "That weapon is not befitting one of royal lineage. I will speak to the King about finding you a proper nail; one that doesn't look as though it would shatter to pieces with the next strike.",
      "RR_DRYYA_OLDNAIL_3": "In the meantime, though, perhaps I should polish my own skills...",
      "RR_DRYYA_CHEATER": "Begone! We don't tolerate cheaters or save editors on these grounds. That, or you're using the placeholder NPC.",
      "RR_HEGEMOL_FIRST_1_1": "I would never have guessed such a small bug could possess strength as mighty as yours. You've surprised me, little one.",
      "RR_HEGEMOL_FIRST_1_2": "When I first saw you, I thought I'd have been able to strike you down with my mighty mace like a nailsmith strikes the anvil, but I couldn't have been more pleasantly surprised.",
      "RR_HEGEMOL_FIRST_1_3": "This reminds me of a time I was training with Isma, ready to charge through the foliage she had created... She summoned a vine that tripped me over and has never let me forget it since.",
      "RR_HEGEMOL_FIRST_2_1": "I do admire your skill with that nail. I could never be so delicate as to handle one without breaking it.",
      "RR_HEGEMOL_FIRST_2_2": "Were I to wield a similar weapon, it would be Ze'mer's. What the smiths of her home must be capable of to produce such a massive, yet refined blade...",
      "RR_HEGEMOL_FIRST_2_3": "Of course, nothing suits me better than my trusty mace. No need to be precise if your position doesn't call for it, and there's nothing quite like the joy of smashing your way through everything in your path.",
      "RR_HEGEMOL_FIRST_2_4": "If I weren't a Knight, perhaps I would make a good mining golem, oho!",
      "RR_HEGEMOL_FIRST_REPEAT": "I suppose you will be seeing my mace on the battlefield again soon.",
      "RR_HEGEMOL_FIRST_DREAM": "My jest returns only silence... You are a strange one little knight...",
      "RR_HEGEMOL_SECOND_1_1": "I'm thoroughly impressed; you've withstood my full force and lived to tell the tale twice now. I'm often called \"Mighty\" Hegemol, but perhaps I ought to pass that title to you.",
      "RR_HEGEMOL_SECOND_1_2": "...Ho, I only jest. Titles are reserved for us Knights, though I'm sure you are more than capable of joining our ranks. Train with us a bit longer, and the King will no doubt grant you the privilege.",
      "RR_HEGEMOL_SECOND_1_3": "...Of course, of course, I know. You've another role to fulfil. But we've a while before you are ready to take on that task. I'd love to fight alongside you, some day, in true combat.",
      "RR_HEGEMOL_SECOND_1_4": "I believe the Battle of the Blackwyrm and Steelcrest Siege would have both been finished far sooner had you been there with us!",
      "RR_HEGEMOL_SECOND_2_1": "If you ever grow larger, you ought to try out a heftier weapon, such as a mace or one akin to Ze'mer's choice. It may not be what you're used to, but it is capable of delivering far more powerful blows than a nail. Er- don't tell Dryya I said that.",
      "RR_HEGEMOL_SECOND_2_2": "Oh, and Ogrim's weapon of choice... It sure has knocked more than one unconscious before even hitting! Ho ho! Isma is quite the thorned vine in the battlefield, but her talents truly bloom when helping others.",
      "RR_HEGEMOL_SECOND_2_3": "Us Knights have quite the unusual fighting methods, don't we? Although I ought to watch what I say before I start us squabbling, ho ho!",
      "RR_HEGEMOL_SECOND_REPEAT": "You are joyous to fight, little knight.",
      "RR_HEGEMOL_SECOND_DREAM": "A strange set of warriors we would be, were it to join our ranks...",
      "RR_HEGEMOL_THIRD_1_1": "Truly, I admire your strength and grace. Many times now have we met in battle, and many times have I lost thoroughly.",
      "RR_HEGEMOL_THIRD_1_2": "You hardly even show any sense of fatigue! An impressive feat of resilience and determination that all aspire to achieve, yet few ever obtain.",
      "RR_HEGEMOL_THIRD_REPEAT": "I shall surely be seeing more of you, little one!",
      "RR_HEGEMOL_THIRD_DREAM": "What the King must have done to produce its resilient nature...",
      "RR_HEGEMOL_CHARM_1": "Those curious spells! The King really taught you well to be capable of such casts, summoning effective weapons from mere soul.",
      "RR_HEGEMOL_CHARM_2": "You almost made me question my coldness towards spell crafting; yet I stick to my ways, I much prefer the simplicity of a nice, hefty swing to punish my enemies.",
      "RR_HEGEMOL_CHARM_3": "While impressive, be cautious of their usage! You've seen the effects in a safe environment so avoid exposing possible bystanders to them.",
      "RR_HEGEMOL_CHEATER": "Begone! We don't tolerate cheaters or save editors on these grounds. That, or you're using the placeholder NPC.",
      "RR_ZEMER_FIRST_1_1": "Ahhhh, Le'mer! Che's nail-play could not match your prowess. A strength seldom met, in this old kingdom.",
      "RR_ZEMER_FIRST_1_2": "Perfect parries, a swift strike, and che' had fallen before knowing. Not my comrades before che' nor che's blade \"Stout\" changed the fair-earned outcome.",
      "RR_ZEMER_FIRST_1_3": "Le'mer, your feats deserve immortalisation in prose. Allow che' to weave such a tale.",
      "RR_ZEMER_FIRST_2_1": "A lecture at start, a trial at last; Dung and Vine, Nail then Mace, so close they all fell and so fast Stout appeared before the pale face.",
      "RR_ZEMER_FIRST_2_2": "Che', last knight on line, was looked upon with so firm its gaze as the grip, its nail clashing che's Stout, promising strength unmatching its petite shape.",
      "RR_ZEMER_FIRST_2_3": "No swing and blow, nor storm and dash would deter its resolve, as che', final kneeling, was looked upon with same unfearful gaze.",
      "RR_ZEMER_FIRST_2_4": "It won to become one stronger. They won to forge one stronger.",
      "RR_ZEMER_FIRST_REPEAT": "A tale hastily crafted, but che' hopes you enjoy it nonetheless.",
      "RR_ZEMER_FIRST_DREAM": "Perhaps it might enjoy one of che's other stories sometime...?",
      "RR_ZEMER_SECOND_1_1": "Le'mer, does che's bloom catch your curiosity? To many before it did. The petals are of different whiteness, unlike any other from the Queen's branches.",
      "RR_ZEMER_SECOND_1_2": "Nahlo, Nahlo, none could match this one, grown only in che's homeland. Its stem is of a fragile quality, little needed to deter its shape.",
      "RR_ZEMER_SECOND_1_3": "But what beauty! Unique than rare, a bloom of utmost value, of meticulous care deserving, of dearest meaning attached.",
      "RR_ZEMER_SECOND_1_4": "And of so many blossoms in her gardens, reluctant the Queen's roots are towards che' petals. Che' wonders why, as che' shudders living without such beauty, moina?",
      "RR_ZEMER_SECOND_2_1": "Me'hon, a tale to tell. One of love, that which the heart aches for.",
      "RR_ZEMER_SECOND_2_2": "A mantis, of the great tribe shrouded in spores. Che' was but escorting the King when che' caught a glance, yet that an ephemeral moment was enough.",
      "RR_ZEMER_SECOND_2_3": "Meled'lover, che' but wishes to see such beauty, such grace once again. Nahlo, che' must.",
      "RR_ZEMER_SECOND_REPEAT": "Che' hopes to see her again soon...",
      "RR_ZEMER_SECOND_DREAM": "None could match her...",
      "RR_ZEMER_THIRD_1_1": "The cycle continues, confirming you worthy. Wai, che' wishes it to be friendly spar and not urgent lecture.",
      "RR_ZEMER_THIRD_1_2": "But a perilous world expects us to fight for life. So long as che' may use che's skills to protect Meled'lover, combat will be part of che's life still.",
      "RR_ZEMER_THIRD_1_3": "Le'mer would appreciate some lessons from che', moina?",
      "RR_ZEMER_THIRD_REPEAT": "Strength is a gift not many possess. Che' may help you train it.",
      "RR_ZEMER_THIRD_DREAM": "Could it end the ruin the light threatens to bring...?",
      "RR_ZEMER_CHARM_1": "...Ah, che's seen spell practice served you well; you focused as our Monarch instructed you, the soul repelling the offender in perfect flow.",
      "RR_ZEMER_CHARM_2": "Yet che' could sense a silent cry from its use, uneasiness while concentrating. Is it of scary duties, longing home...?",
      "RR_ZEMER_CHARM_3": "...Ah, che's apologies for digressing. Me'hon, che' hopes Le'mer can use it for good. Use the cast very wisely.",
      "RR_ZEMER_CHEATER": "Begone! We don't tolerate cheaters or save editors on these grounds. That, or you're using the placeholder NPC."

Seguro que lo habéis visto en vuestra travesía a este lugar de espinas descuidadas e intrusos cegados.<page>¿Es por eso que estáis tan callados? Isma, sin duda entiendes el pésimo estado de una vegetación bajo tal sufrimiento, agravado aún por la responsabilidad y el arrepentimiento.<page>Tu presencia es un gran alivio para mi cuerpo marchito, evocando preciosos recuerdos de un tiempo pasado.

Aunque estés envuelta en tristeza, me alivia sentirte de nuevo, mi caballera Ze'mer.<page>Ninguna flor tuya puedo notar. ¿Se la has llevado a tu amada caída? Su tumba debe estar bien cuidada.<page>¿Qué te trae a este refugio? Por supuesto habrás visto el campo de batalla sobre nosotras. Cuerpos acumulados en los arbustos.<page>No puedo hacer nada por consolar tu gran pérdida, pero no rechazaré tu deseo si quieres pasar un tiempo conmigo.",
      "WL_VL_2": "Agradezco tu presencia. Aunque sea breve, nadie habría previsto esta visita.<page>Dryya sigue en posición a la entrada, así que no encontrarás enemigos cuando te marches de este refugio. Eso sí, no bajes la guardia en los jardines.",
      "WL_ALL_1": "¿Es esto real...? Tantos visitantes, pero tanto vacío alrededor. ¿Están mis brotes distorsionando la percepción de mi entorno? ¿O habéis sido siempre tan diminutos?<page>Debéis comprender mi escepticismo, mis Cinco queridos. Solo soy capaz de ver a través de otros medios, y estos no podrían haber presagiado la reunión de los Grandes Caballeros en estos tiempos difíciles.<page>Si no fuese porque noto vuestra tenue presencia, creería haber perdido la cabeza por completo.<page>Vuestra llegada me trae recuerdos de tiempos felices, desde relatos legendarios a patrullas ordinarias... Sin duda añoráis esos momentos, como lo hacen los insectos que todavía sobreviven. Yo también los extraño.<page>Incluso aunque permanezcáis callados, me alivia saber que seguís realizando vuestro deber a pesar de la presión. Este reino tiene suerte de tener unos protectores como vosotros.",
      "WL_ALL_2": "¿Está vuestro silencio causado por mi presencia? Sabed que no tenéis obligación de quedaros, pues no poseo un título.

      "RR_ISMA_FIRST_1_2": "¿Te entrenó el rey? Nunca he visto a nuestro soberano coger un arma, pero su destreza debe ser increíble si le ayudó a formar un reino tan magnífico.",
      "RR_ISMA_FIRST_1_3": "Me pregunto qué se le pasó por la cabeza a aquel guerrero rojo para atentar contra un Wyrm de manera tan insensata... Lo siento por ese difunto traidor.",

      "RR_ISMA_SECOND_2_2": "Tienen un aura que no puedo describir y parece que influyen en Ze'mer de algún modo. Tal vez sean la razón de la aversión de la reina. Más que aversión..., quizá las evita por prudencia.",

      "RR_DRYYA_FIRST_1_1": "Ah, eres tú. Puedes entrar.",
      "RR_DRYYA_FIRST_1_2": "Me he mantenido alerta desde que nos llegaron noticias de esa..., infección. Aunque mi deber como caballera es proteger a los habitantes del reino, ha sido difícil. Especialmente protegerlos de un peligro que no se ve ni se siente.",
      "RR_DRYYA_FIRST_1_3": "Aquellos infectados atacan sin control, a amigos y conocidos. Muchos no tienen valor para alzar sus aguijones contra los infectados.",
      "RR_DRYYA_FIRST_1_4": "Pero pienso que no tienes de qué preocuparte, pues el rey nos dice que posees un vacío que te vuelve inmune a sus efectos.",
      "RR_DRYYA_FIRST_2_1": "Tu técnica de combate es impecable. No me sentía tan eufórica en una pelea de aguijones desde hacía tiempo. Por mucho que Hegemol alardee de su tamaño y sus golpes, su corpulencia lo hace vulnerable. No le cuentes que he dicho eso.",
      "RR_DRYYA_FIRST_2_2": "Isma se centra más en esparcir plantas aquí y allá con rapidez, distrayendo al enemigo antes de golpearlo ella misma. Parece que Ogrim está imitando su técnica con sus..., proyectiles.",
      "RR_DRYYA_FIRST_2_3": "Mi estilo se parece bastante al tuyo y, aun así, no conseguí asestarte ni un golpe certero. Eres un rival digno, con una fuerza que compite con la de Ze'mer y la mía.",
      "RR_DRYYA_FIRST_2_4": "Quizá algún día nos sobrepases a todos. ¿O acaso es muy pronto para saberlo?",
      "RR_DRYYA_FIRST_REPEAT": "Ahora tengo que centrarme en mis obligaciones. Tal vez podamos hablar en otra ocasión.",
      "RR_DRYYA_FIRST_DREAM": "Amar, preocuparse... ¿No son necesarios para defender nuestro querido reino?",
      "RR_DRYYA_SECOND_1_1": "Tu perfeccionado estilo es envidiable y asombroso viniendo de una larva como tú. Aparte de que no lo has conseguido una, sino dos veces...",
      "RR_DRYYA_SECOND_1_2": "Me pregunto qué pasará cuando crezcas. Sería una lástima que perdieses movilidad al crecer, aunque no sería extraño...",
      "RR_DRYYA_SECOND_1_3": "Puede que Ze'mer te enseñe a moverte tan rápido como ella, a pesar de su estatura. Ninguno de nosotros lo logró, pero tú pareces diferente...",
      "RR_DRYYA_SECOND_2_1": "Afilar el aguijón es un arte, ¿sabes? Si alguna vez necesitas pulir tu arma, te ayudaré encantada.",
      "RR_DRYYA_SECOND_2_2": "Veo que tu aguijón también ha sido forjado con Mineral Pálido. Este procede de la Corona del reino, donde pocos se han atrevido a ir.",
      "RR_DRYYA_SECOND_2_2_ALT": "Mi aguijón fue forjado con Mineral Pálido. Procede de la Corona del reino, donde pocos se han atrevido a ir.",
      "RR_DRYYA_SECOND_2_3": "Me alegra haber conseguido con facilidad el mineral que muchos forjaguijones luchan por obtener. El mío no era más que un trozo que trajeron de las cumbres del reino. Todavía no lo han extraído todo, seguro que algún viajero se alegrará de encontrar el resto.",
      "RR_DRYYA_SECOND_2_3_ALT": "Me alegra haber conseguido con facilidad el mineral que muchos forjaguijones se pelean por obtener. Había más incrustados en la piedra de la cumbre, así que probablemente sea útil para tu hoja gastada.",
      "RR_DRYYA_SECOND_REPEAT": "Voy a seguir vigilando, entonces. Seguro que los demás tienen mucho que contarte.",
      "RR_DRYYA_SECOND_DREAM": "De su aguijón emana un aura real... Debió ser creada por un maestro forjaguijones, no hay duda...",
      "RR_DRYYA_THIRD_1_1": "Parece que he encontrado un rival digno. Me da que no es necesario que me ofrezca a afilarse el aguijón, si sigues manejándolo con tanta destreza.",
      "RR_DRYYA_THIRD_1_2": "Imagino que te veré en la arena muy pronto.",
      "RR_DRYYA_THIRD_REPEAT": "Imagino que te veré en la arena muy pronto.",
      "RR_DRYYA_THIRD_DREAM": "Mi reina está preocupada..., pero quizás pueda enfrentarse a la infección y salir ileso.",
      "RR_DRYYA_CHARM_1": "He observado tus ataques incesantes en la prueba. Nuestro largo entrenamiento ha dado sus frutos y has triunfado con rapidez.",
      "RR_DRYYA_CHARM_2": "Has dominado la técnica hasta tal punto de hacerla tuya. Mereces que te elogie por ello.",
      "RR_DRYYA_CHARM_3": "Recuerda: no sueltes a tu adversario una vez lo alcances. Si no les das un respiro, no podrán contraatacar.",
      "RR_DRYYA_OLDNAIL_1": "¿Debería ofenderme o asombrarme porque me hayas derrotado con un aguijón tan gastado...? Nunca había visto un instrumento en tal mal estado.",
      "RR_DRYYA_OLDNAIL_2": "Esa arma no es apropiada para alguien de estirpe real. Hablaré con el rey para que te procure un aguijón decente, uno que no parezca que vaya a hacerse añicos con el siguiente golpe.",
      "RR_DRYYA_OLDNAIL_3": "Supongo que de momento debería pulir mis habilidades...",
      "RR_DRYYA_CHEATER": "¡Largo! No toleramos a tramposos o aquellos que editan sus partidas en estas tierras. Eso o estás usando un PNJ provisional.",
      "RR_HEGEMOL_FIRST_1_1": "Nunca habría adivinado que un bichito como tú pudiese ser tan poderoso. Me has sorprendido, pequeñín.",
      "RR_HEGEMOL_FIRST_1_2": "Cuando te vi por primera vez, pensé que podría derribarte con mi formidable maza como un forjaguijones golpea el yunque. Pero menuda sorpresa agradable me he llevado.",
      "RR_HEGEMOL_FIRST_1_3": "Esto me recuerda a una vez que estaba entrenando con Isma, listo para embestir a través de la maleza que había creado... Invocó una enredadera que me hizo tropezar y no deja de recordármelo desde entonces.",
      "RR_HEGEMOL_FIRST_2_1": "Admiro tu manejo del aguijón. Nunca podría coger uno con la delicadeza necesaria para no romperlo.",
      "RR_HEGEMOL_FIRST_2_2": "Si tuviese que utilizar un arma similar, escogería la de Ze'mer. La habilidad que deben tener los forjadores de su tierra para producir una hoja tan gigantesca y a la vez refinada...",
      "RR_HEGEMOL_FIRST_2_3": "Por supuesto, nada me va mejor que mi fiel maza. No hace falta ser preciso si tu posición no lo requiere. Aparte, no hay nada más divertido que aplastar todo lo que se interpone en tu camino.",
      "RR_HEGEMOL_FIRST_2_4": "Si no fuese Caballero, quizá habría sido un buen gólem minero. ¡Jo, jo!",
      "RR_HEGEMOL_FIRST_REPEAT": "Creo que pronto verás mi maza en el campo de batalla.",
      "RR_HEGEMOL_FIRST_DREAM": "Mis bromas solo provocan silencio... Eres extraño, pequeño caballero...",
      "RR_HEGEMOL_SECOND_1_1": "Estoy realmente asombrado. Has resistido mi fuerza bruta y sobrevivido para contarlo por segunda vez. Me suelen llamar el «poderoso» Hegemol, pero quizá tenga que cederte el título.",
      "RR_HEGEMOL_SECOND_1_2": "Jo, jo. Estoy de broma. Los títulos se reservan para nosotros Caballeros, aunque no me cabe duda de que puedas unirte a nosotros. Sigue entrenando con nosotros y seguro que el rey te concederá ese privilegio.",
      "RR_HEGEMOL_SECOND_1_3": "Lo sé, lo sé... Tienes un papel que cumplir, pero todavía tenemos tiempo antes de que tengas que asumir tu deber. Me encantaría luchar a tu lado algún día en un combate real.",
      "RR_HEGEMOL_SECOND_1_4": "Si hubieses estado en la batalla del Wyrm Negro y el asedio de Crestacero, habríamos acabado en un abrir y cerrar de ojos.",
      "RR_HEGEMOL_SECOND_2_1": "Si llegas a crecer, deberías probar con un arma más pesada: una maza o una que se parezca a la de Ze'mer. Puede que no estés acostumbrado, pero te permitiría propinar golpes más potentes que los de un aguijón. Esto... No se lo digas a Dryya.",
      "RR_HEGEMOL_SECOND_2_2": "Y no hablemos del «arma» de Ogrim... Ha noqueado a más de uno antes de golpear siquiera. ¡Jo, jo! Isma es toda una enredadera espinosa en combate, pero sus talentos florecen de verdad cuando ayuda a otros.",
      "RR_HEGEMOL_SECOND_2_3": "Los Caballeros tenemos métodos de lucha bastante inusuales, ¿no crees? Mejor que tenga cuidado con lo que digo, no vaya a ser que nos peleemos. ¡Jo, jo!",
      "RR_HEGEMOL_SECOND_REPEAT": "Es un deleite luchar contra ti, pequeño caballero.",
      "RR_HEGEMOL_SECOND_DREAM": "Menudo conjunto variopinto de guerreros seríamos si se uniese a nosotros...",
      "RR_HEGEMOL_THIRD_1_1": "Admiro tu fuerza y elegancia, de veras. Ya nos hemos encontrado en combate varias veces y he perdido contra ti otras tantas.",
      "RR_HEGEMOL_THIRD_1_2": "Y apenas muestras indicios de fatiga. Una proeza extraordinaria en cuanto a resistencia y determinación que todos aspiramos a lograr, pero muy pocos consiguen.",
      "RR_HEGEMOL_THIRD_REPEAT": "Da por hecho que nos veremos de nuevo, pequeñín.",
      "RR_HEGEMOL_THIRD_DREAM": "¿Qué habrá hecho el rey para crear algo de naturaleza tan resistente...?",
      "RR_HEGEMOL_CHARM_1": "¡Qué hechizos tan curiosos! El rey te ha enseñado bien si eres capaz de lanzar tales conjuros. Invocar armas eficaces a partir de simple alma...",
      "RR_HEGEMOL_CHARM_2": "Casi haces que me cuestione mi desapego por la hechicería. Aun así me ciño a mi estilo, pues prefiero la sencillez de golpear a mis enemigos con fuerza bruta.",
      "RR_HEGEMOL_CHARM_3": "Son asombrosos, pero ten cuidado al usarlos. Has visto sus efectos en un entorno controlado, así que evita que algún viandante sea expuesto a ellos.",
      "RR_HEGEMOL_CHEATER": "¡Largo! No toleramos a tramposos o aquellos que editan sus partidas en estas tierras. Eso o estás usando un PNJ provisional.",
      "RR_ZEMER_FIRST_1_1": "¡Ahhh, Le'mer! La técnica de Che' no es rival para tu destreza. Una fuerza casi nunca igualada en este viejo reino.",
      "RR_ZEMER_FIRST_1_2": "Desvíos perfectos, golpes veloces, y che' cayó antes de darse cuenta. Ni siquiera mis camaradas antes de che', ni la hoja de che' «Robusta» cambiaron este merecido desenlace.",
      "RR_ZEMER_FIRST_1_3": "Le'mer, tus logros merecen ser inmortalizados en prosa. Deja que che' te componga tal relato.",
      "RR_ZEMER_FIRST_2_1": "Una lección al principio, una prueba al final. Estiércol y enredadera, aguijón y maza, tan pronto cayeron y tan rápido apareció Robusta ante el pálido rostro.",
      "RR_ZEMER_FIRST_2_2": "Che', la última caballera, la miró con ojos firmes como su empuñadura, chocó su aguijón con Robusta, con una fuerza prometedora que no se correspondía con su diminuto tamaño.",
      "RR_ZEMER_FIRST_2_3": "Ni giros, ni golpes, ni tormentas, ni cortes pueden disuadir su determinación. Che', arrodillada al fin, recibía la misma mirada sin temor.",
      "RR_ZEMER_FIRST_2_4": "Venció para volverse más fuerte. Vencieron para hacerlo más fuerte.",
      "RR_ZEMER_FIRST_REPEAT": "Un relato apresurado, pero che' espera que aun así lo hayas disfrutado.",
      "RR_ZEMER_FIRST_DREAM": "¿Quizá pueda deleitarse con una de las historias de che'...?",
      "RR_ZEMER_SECOND_1_1": "Le'mer, ¿te llama la atención la flor de che'? A muchos otros también. La blancura de sus pétalos es distinta y no se parece a la de las ramas de la reina.",
      "RR_ZEMER_SECOND_1_2": "Nahlo, Nahlo, ninguna otra podría igualarla. Crecen solo en la tierra de che'. Su tallo es de naturaleza frágil, basta poco para quebrantar su forma.",
      "RR_ZEMER_SECOND_1_3": "¡Pero qué belleza! Más que extraña: única. Una flor inestimable, merecedora de meticuloso cuidado, portadora de un significado valioso.",
      "RR_ZEMER_SECOND_1_4": "Y de tantos brotes en sus jardines, las raíces de la reina reacias son hacia los pétalos de che'. Che' se pregunta por qué, mientras che' tiembla de pensar en vivir sin tal belleza, ¿moina?",
      "RR_ZEMER_SECOND_2_1": "Me'hon, una historia digna de contar. Una de amor, de las que anhela el corazón.",
      "RR_ZEMER_SECOND_2_2": "Una mantis de la gran tribu envuelta en esporas. Che' escoltaba al rey cuando la atisbé. Un momento efímero fue suficiente.",
      "RR_ZEMER_SECOND_2_3": "Meled'amor, che' desea ver tal belleza, tal gracia una vez más. Nahlo, che' debe verla.",
      "RR_ZEMER_SECOND_REPEAT": "Che' espera volver a verla pronto...",
      "RR_ZEMER_SECOND_DREAM": "Nadie se compara con ella...",
      "RR_ZEMER_THIRD_1_1": "El ciclo continúa, demuestra que eres digno. Wai, che' espera que sea combate amistoso y no una lección urgente.",
      "RR_ZEMER_THIRD_1_2": "Mas este mundo peligroso espera que luchemos para sobrevivir. Mientras che' emplee las habilidades de che' para proteger a Meled'amor, el duelo seguirá siendo parte de la vida de che'.",
      "RR_ZEMER_THIRD_1_3": "¿Consideraría Le'mer lecciones de che', moina?",
      "RR_ZEMER_THIRD_REPEAT": "La fuerza es un don no muchos tienen. Che' puede ayudarte a entrenarla.",
      "RR_ZEMER_THIRD_DREAM": "¿Conseguiría acabar con la ruina que la luz amenaza con traer...?",
      "RR_ZEMER_CHARM_1": "Ah... Che' ve que la práctica de hechizos te ha venido bien. Concentrado como nuestro monarca te enseñó, el alma rechazando al adversario con perfecta fluidez.",
      "RR_ZEMER_CHARM_2": "No obstante che' puede sentir un grito silencioso al usarlo, un desasosiego al concentrarse. ¿Le aterra su deber...? ¿Echará de menos su hogar...?",
      "RR_ZEMER_CHARM_3": "Ah... Che' se disculpa por divagar. Me'hon, che' confía en que Le'mer lo use para el bien. Ten mucha prudencia al usarlo.",

Votre odeur est tellement plus puissante quand vous êtes ensembles.<page>Loyauté et gentillesse : des qualités importantes mais oubliées en ces tristes temps. Vous l'avez sans doute constaté lors de votre périple aux travers de ronces sans fin et d'intrus aveuglés.<page>Est-ce là la raison de votre silence ? Isma, vous ne devez sûrement pas être étonnée de la fragilité d'une plante soumise à de tels maux, en plus aggravée par le poids des remords et de la responsabilité.<page>Votre présence me change de mon ermitage et mon corps amoindri, tant de souvenirs me reviennent. Je vous remercie de votre visite.",
      "WL_KH_2": "Lorsque vous partirez, si vous n'avez déjà, je vous en prie, passez voir Dryya.<page>Malgré son apparente froideur, Isma, elle tient beaucoup à vous, comme au reste des chevaliers. Ogrim le sait, j'en suis certaine.",

Arrêtez de combattre, je vous en prie; et laissez-moi soigner vos blessures, votre Dame peut encore être utile.<page>Ne vous fâchez pas, ne vous sentez pas menacée. Mes racines ne perçoivent plus aucun danger; je peux vous garantir que Seigneur des traîtres n'est plus.<page>J'ai entendu le terrible combat et soudain, plus rien. Vous demeurez vigilante et victorieuse Dryya, n'est ce pas ?<page>Vous m'avez encore très bien servie mon chevalier, si bien servie. Reposez vous, restez ici pendant quelque temps; je me chargerai de tout problème potentiel.",
      "WL_MP_2": "Je vous donnerais bien l'ordre de rester ici, mais je ne peux m'opposer à votre volonté. Faites, je ne vous en voudrai point. Considérez juste ma retraite également la vôtre.<page>Que votre esprit reste vif et votre aiguillon rapide. Soyez prudente.",

Je ne peux rien faire pour l'en empêcher.<page>M'étant forcée à rester ici, je suis reconnaissante de votre venue. Je n'avais pas conscience d'à quel point votre présence me manquait, malgré votre actuel silence.<page>Je vous confie les habitants et leur futur. Mettez la ville à l'abri sous votre ombre. Faites tout ce qui est nécessaire.",
      "WL_BH_2": "Avant que vous ne partiez, une dernière demande : dites à Dryya de se reposer.<page>Cela fait si longtemps qu'elle fait son devoir sans s'être jamais trop éloignée des griffes d'un infecté. Elle entendra sûrement les conseils d'un bon ami.",

Même si nappée de chagrin, je suis heureuse de vous revoir Ze'mer, mon chevalier.<page>Je ne perçois aucune de ces fleurs qui vous sont si chères; en avez-vous amené une là où repose votre bien-aimée ? Sa tombe doit être si bien entretenue.<page>D'où me vient l'honneur de votre présence ? Vous avez sans doute vu le champ de bataille au-dessus de nous, rien d'autre que des corps empilés dans les buissons.<page>... Je ne peux réduire votre peine, mais si vous souhaitez passer quelque temps ici, je ne m'opposerai à votre volonté.",
      "WL_VL_2": "Je suis reconnaissante de votre présence, aussi brève soit elle, personne n'aurait pu prévoir une telle visite.<page>Dryya est toujours à son poste à l'entrée, vous ne croiserez donc pas d'ennemis lors de votre sortie de ce havre. Restez toutefois vigilante dans ces jardins.",

Ou avez-vous tous toujours été si minuscules ?<page>Comprenez mon scepticisme, mes chers Grands Chevaliers : je ne peux voir que par quelque moyen détourné et en ces temps difficiles je n'aurais jamais conçu que les Grands Chevaliers se réunissent de nouveau. Ne serait-ce pour cette faible présence que je perçois; je me serais cru folle.<page>Votre venue me rappelle tant de joyeux souvenirs d'un temps meilleur, de récits légendaires aux patrouilles les plus ordinaires... Ces moments doivent aussi vous manquer, comme à tous les insectes encore en vie. Je donnerais tout pour pouvoir les revivre.<page>Cependant, malgré votre mutisme, il est bon de savoir que vous faites toujours votre devoir en ces temps. Ce royaume gagne tant à avoir des protecteurs tels que vous.",
      "WL_ALL_2": "Votre silence est-il dû à ma présence ? Soyez certains que nul devoir ne vous force ici, je n'ai aucun titre. Si vous préférez partir et discuter avec les autres faites ainsi, n'attendez pas un ordre de ma part.<page>Dans tous les cas, vous êtes toujours les bienvenus ici.

      "RR_HEGEMOL_SECOND_1_2": "... Ho, je plaisante. Ces titres sont réservés à nous autres Chevaliers, mais tu es plus que capable de rejoindre nos rangs. Entraîne toi avec nous un peu plus et le roi t'adoubera sans doute.",
      "RR_HEGEMOL_SECOND_1_3": "... Oui, je sais.. tu as d'autres devoirs. Mais tu dois encore t'entraîner un moment avant d'être prêt. J'aimerais bien un jour combattre à tes côtés, lors d'un conflit réel.",

      "RR_HEGEMOL_SECOND_2_2": "Ho, et l'arme favorite d'Ogrim... Il en a fait s'évanouir plus d'un, avant même de les toucher ! Ho Ho ! Isma en combat est une véritable épine dans le pied ! Mais ses talents éclosent réellement quand elle aide les autres.",

      "RR_DRYYA_FIRST_2_2": "Isma invece si appoggia alla sua agilità spargendo semi e piante per distrarre il nemico prima di poterlo colpire. Pure Ogrim sembra imitare la sua strategia con i suoi... proiettili.",

      "RR_DRYYA_FIRST_2_2": "イズマは機敏さを活かして周囲に植物を散らばせ、敵が混乱する隙に攻撃をします。オグリムも彼の飛び道具を使って、その手法を真似ているようですね。",
      "RR_DRYYA_FIRST_2_3": "わたくしと同じ戦術を使うあなたに、決定的な一撃を見舞うことができませんでした。あなたは、わたくしやゼ＝メールと同等の力をお持ちなのですね。",

      "RR_HEGEMOL_SECOND_1_1": "俺の全力を二度受けてなお立ち上がるとは、感心した。俺は“力の”ヘゲモルとも呼ばれることがあるが、おまえがその二つ名を引き継ぐのかもしれんな。",
      "RR_HEGEMOL_SECOND_1_2": "…いや、ただの冗談だ。二つ名はわれわれ騎士のみに与えられる特権だ。しかしこのまま特訓すれば、王はいつかおまえにも騎士の特権を与えるだろう。",
      "RR_HEGEMOL_SECOND_1_3": "…わかってる、わかってる。おまえが果たすべき役割があることは承知の上だ。だがそのときはまだ来ていない。それまでにおまえの横で戦えることを願う。",
      "RR_HEGEMOL_SECOND_1_4": "黒ウィルムの戦争や鉄兜の襲来もおまえがいれば楽勝だったかもしれんな！",
      "RR_HEGEMOL_SECOND_2_1": "いつか身体が大きくなれば、俺のメイスやゼ＝メールの大剣のような、もう少し重みのある武器を試すといいぞ。<page>なれている釘とは違うかもしれんが、釘よりも強力な一撃を与えられるぞ。ドライヤにそれを言ってはいけないがな。",
      "RR_HEGEMOL_SECOND_2_2": "オグリムの使っている武器は相手を攻撃する前に気絶させることもあるな！　イズマのムチも強靭だが、その性能は見方を支援しているときにさらに開花する。",

      "RR_HEGEMOL_CHARM_1": "その奇妙な魔法はもしや！　王もよくソウルで武器を作り上げるように教え込んだものだ。",
      "RR_HEGEMOL_CHARM_2": "俺の魔法への冷たい態度も考えさせられる。それでもけっきょくこのメイスで敵を叩きのめしつづけるだけだが。",
      "RR_HEGEMOL_CHARM_3": "その技は派手だが、そのぶん危険でもあるぞ！　安全な環境で試せているからこそわかると思うが、市民に向けるんじゃないぞ。",

      "RR_ZEMER_FIRST_1_1": "ああ、そち！　わらわの釘術はそちの武術にかなわぬ。この古き王国でその力に匹敵するものはごく少数だ。",
      "RR_ZEMER_FIRST_1_2": "完璧な受け流し、光のような斬り、そして気づかぬ間にわらわは敗れていた。わらわの同志も、わらわの大剣“頑固”もその結末を変えられぬ。",

      "RR_ZEMER_FIRST_2_1": "指導は幕を開け、試練は結末へと導く。フンとツタ、釘、そしてメイス、彼らは同時に崩れ落ち、早くも“頑固”が蒼白な顔の前に現れた。",
      "RR_ZEMER_FIRST_2_2": "そして最後の騎士が立つ。その相手の視線は握力と同じくらいに強固で、その小さな形状に比べて無比の強さを誓う。その釘が彼の堅固さとぶつかり合う。",
      "RR_ZEMER_FIRST_2_3": "振り回しも打撃も、嵐も突進も、彼の不動の決意を揺さぶることはない。騎士が最後にひざを地につくその姿が、変わらず恐れを知らぬ視線で注視される。",
      "RR_ZEMER_FIRST_2_4": "より強い存在へと昇華することに成功した。より強く鍛え上げることに成功した。",

      "RR_ZEMER_SECOND_1_2": "ナーロ、ナーロ、この花と対等なものはあらぬ。わらわの故郷でしか咲かず、その繊細なくきも容易に変形してしまう。",
      "RR_ZEMER_SECOND_1_3": "だがその美しさ！　珍しいもの以上にユニークで、最も価値のある花、注意深く育てられるべき愛おしい意味がそえられている。かけがえのあらぬ秘宝である。",
      "RR_ZEMER_SECOND_1_4": "そしてその緑におおわれた庭に咲き散る花ばたけから根をそむける女王…美しさなき生を思えぬ故、花を避ける理由がわからぬ。",

      "RR_ZEMER_CHARM_1": "ああ、そちの魔術の特訓が役に立っているようだ。王の指導通りにソウルを集中させ、そのソウルが敵を弾く。",
      "RR_ZEMER_CHARM_2": "しかしその集中から苦しみに泣く声もかすかに感じる。使命への恐怖、それとも故郷への切望…？",
      "RR_ZEMER_CHARM_3": "…ああ、自らの想いに沈んでいた。メホン、わらわはそちがその力をまっとうに使えると信じる。魔法は注意して使うのだ。",

      "RR_OGRIM_SECOND_2_1": "Você já viu os jardins escondidos aqui? Nossa Rainha cultivou vários deles nos terrenos do palácio, atrás de salões pálidos e quartos imaculados. É o lugar perfeito para aliviar seus nervos depois de um turno cansativo.",
      "RR_OGRIM_SECOND_2_2": "Isma me disse que adoraria criar seu próprio jardim em sua casa. Eu me pergunto se as plantas sobreviverão com a pouquíssima luz que passa pelos canos dos cursos d'água.",
      "RR_OGRIM_SECOND_2_3": "No entanto, se isso acontecer, eu adoraria ter algumas plantas! Ela poderia me ensinar a cuidar delas!",
      "RR_OGRIM_SECOND_REPEAT": "De qualquer forma, você parece estar aprendendo rápido. Com esse ritmo você superará todos em pouco tempo!",
      "RR_OGRIM_SECOND_DREAM": "Pode ficar ainda melhor...?",
      "RR_OGRIM_THIRD_1_1": "Suas habilidades são impressionantes! É uma sorte que você esteja do nosso lado, senão teríamos tido problemas.",
      "RR_OGRIM_THIRD_1_2": "Mal posso esperar para vê-lo novamente na batalha!",
      "RR_OGRIM_THIRD_REPEAT": "Mal posso esperar para vê-lo novamente!",
      "RR_OGRIM_THIRD_DREAM": "O rei estava certo: Isso salvará Hallownest...",
      "RR_OGRIM_CHARM_1": "Então você está usando meu presente! A aura leal combina tão bem com você que pensei que fosse seu próprio aroma heroico!",
      "RR_OGRIM_CHARM_2": "Este é um amuleto criado com muito cuidado e cautela, concedido a mim por nosso querido Rei, pois provei minha lealdade a Ele.",
      "RR_OGRIM_CHARM_3": "Sua habilidade e honra provaram que você é digno de usar meu brasão. Ele lhe servirá bem, você tem minha estima amigo!",
      "RR_OGRIM_CHEATER": "Desapareça! Não toleramos trapaceiros ou editores de arquivos aqui. Isso, ou você está usando o NPC.",
      "RR_ISMA_FIRST_1_1": "Ahh, que maravilha finalmente conversar com o misterioso cavaleiro! Não vi muitas pessoas com essa habilidade de manejar um ferrão. Além da nossa Dryya, é claro!",
      "RR_ISMA_FIRST_1_2": "Foi o rei que o treinou? Nunca vi nosso Senhor segurar uma arma, mas sua proeza em combate deve ser realmente grande para tê-lo ajudado a formar um reino tão maravilhoso.",
      "RR_ISMA_FIRST_1_3": "Eu me pergunto o que passou pela cabeça daquele guerreiro vermelho para tentar tão inutilmente contra a vida de um wyrm...? Sinto pena daquele traidor morto.",
      "RR_ISMA_FIRST_2_1": "Ver Ogrim duelando com você me fez querer entrar na luta antes da minha vez! Peço desculpas se te assustei um pouco lá.",
      "RR_ISMA_FIRST_2_2": "Você parecia ser um oponente tão divertido para lutar contra! E estávamos ansiosos para experimentar nossos movimentos especiais juntos de qualquer maneira. Nada se compara a lutar com seu... amigo.",
      "RR_ISMA_FIRST_2_3": "Não está acontecendo nada entre Ogrim e eu. Não, absolutamente nada. Não precisa se preocupar com assuntos tão triviais. Concentre-se em seu treinamento! Entendo que você tem um papel a cumprir em nosso reino.",
      "RR_ISMA_FIRST_REPEAT": "Agora vá! Não seria correto mantê-lo comigo quando tenho certeza de que os outros adorariam conversar.",
      "RR_ISMA_FIRST_DREAM": "Bem curioso, com certeza... Que segredos o rei guardou para criar tanta força...?",
      "RR_ISMA_SECOND_1_1": "Você parece ter se acostumado mais com nossos movimentos, especialmente em uma arena tão pouco convencional.",
      "RR_ISMA_SECOND_1_2": "Lutar é ainda mais divertido em um ambiente do nosso agrado, certo? Felizmente para nós, o palácio é tão grande que nosso monarca nos deu espaço apenas para as sessões de treino.",
      "RR_ISMA_SECOND_1_3": "Estrume, espinhos e flores... Não é mais agradável aos olhos do que a mera brancura? Nosso Rei parece não se importar com o mau cheiro, de alguma forma!",
      "RR_ISMA_SECOND_2_1": "Você notou essas flores brancas quando Ze'mer se junta à luta? Acho que nunca vi uma planta tão frágil e, ainda assim, tão rápida para se espalhar.",
      "RR_ISMA_SECOND_2_2": "Há uma aura sobre eles que não consigo identificar e que parece influenciar Ze'mer de alguma forma. Talvez seja esse o motivo da... não, não é aversão, mas sim... prudência da rainha?",
      "RR_ISMA_SECOND_2_3": "No entanto, é uma alegria ver a vegetação crescer em um campo de batalha.",
      "RR_ISMA_SECOND_REPEAT": "Vamos nos encontrar novamente em combate!",
      "RR_ISMA_SECOND_DREAM": "Poderia se tornar um cavaleiro temível com treinamento e tempo suficientes...",
      "RR_ISMA_THIRD_1_1": "Mais uma vitória para você! Devo lhe agradecer, pois todos nós Cavaleiros melhoramos em combate por meio de nossos duelos.",
      "RR_ISMA_THIRD_1_2": "Espero vê-lo novamente em breve!",
      "RR_ISMA_THIRD_REPEAT": "Espero vê-lo novamente em breve!",
      "RR_ISMA_THIRD_DREAM": "Uma aura pálida, como a do Rei...",
      "RR_ISMA_CHARM_1": "Ah, você deve estar usando o amuleto do Ogrim! O cheiro era tão indistinguível do dele que pensei que fosse minha imaginação.",
      "RR_ISMA_CHARM_2": "Ele deve tê-lo considerado digno de lhe confiar um presente tão querido, e posso ver o motivo pela valentia com que você lutou.",
      "RR_ISMA_CHARM_3": "Cuide bem dele, pois eu tenho grande estima por este amuleto. Espero que ele lhe sirva bem!",
      "RR_ISMA_CHEATER": "Desapareça! Não toleramos trapaceiros ou editores de arquivos aqui. Isso, ou você está usando o NPC.",
      "RR_DRYYA_FIRST_1_1": "Oh, é você. Você pode entrar.",
      "RR_DRYYA_FIRST_1_2": "Tenho me esforçado para ficar alerta desde que as notícias dessa... Infecção chegaram até nós. Embora seja dever de um cavaleiro proteger os cidadãos de um reino, tem sido difícil, especialmente contra um perigo que não é visto nem sentido.",
      "RR_DRYYA_FIRST_1_3": "Os insetos afetados atacarão os outros sem restrições, mesmo aqueles com os quais estão familiarizados; muitos não têm força para voltar seus ferrões contra os infectados.",
      "RR_DRYYA_FIRST_1_4": "Mas acho que você não precisa se preocupar com isso, pois o Rei nos fala de um vazio que você possui e que o torna imune aos seus efeitos.",
      "RR_DRYYA_FIRST_2_1": "Suas habilidades de combate são realmente excelentes. Eu não me sentia tão empolgada em uma luta com ferrões há muito tempo. Embora Hegemol se gabe de seu tamanho e de seus golpes, acho que seu volume frequentemente o deixa vulnerável. Mas não diga a ele que eu disse isso.",
      "RR_DRYYA_FIRST_2_2": "Isma confia em sua rapidez para espalhar suas plantas por toda parte, distraindo seus inimigos antes dela atacar. Ogrim também parece estar imitando as técnicas dela por meio de seus... projéteis.",
      "RR_DRYYA_FIRST_2_3": "Meu estilo é o mais parecido com o seu e, ainda assim, não consegui acertar um golpe decisivo em você. Um oponente desafiador, com certeza, com uma força que rivaliza com a minha e a de Ze'mer.",
      "RR_DRYYA_FIRST_2_4": "Talvez você supere todos nós um dia. Ou talvez você já tenha feito isso?",
      "RR_DRYYA_FIRST_REPEAT": "Devo me concentrar em minhas obrigações agora. Talvez possamos conversar novamente em outro momento.",
      "RR_DRYYA_FIRST_DREAM": "Amar, cuidar... Isso não é necessário para salvar nosso querido reino?",
      "RR_DRYYA_SECOND_1_1": "Seu estilo é de dar inveja, formidável para uma pessoa como você. E realizá-lo não apenas uma, mas duas vezes...",
      "RR_DRYYA_SECOND_1_2": "O que será que vai acontecer quando você crescer? Seria uma pena se você perdesse sua mobilidade com a idade, embora previsível...",
      "RR_DRYYA_SECOND_1_3": "Talvez Ze'mer possa te ensinar como ela se move tão rapidamente, apesar de sua estatura. Nenhum de nós jamais conseguiu aprender adequadamente, mas você parece ser diferente.",
      "RR_DRYYA_SECOND_2_1": "Afiar o ferrão é uma arte sabe? Se você precisar dar um polimento em sua arma, estou à disposição para ajudar com prazer.",
      "RR_DRYYA_SECOND_2_2": "Parece que seu ferrão também foi forjado com minério pálido. A minha veio da Coroa do Reino, onde poucos se aventuraram antes.",
      "RR_DRYYA_SECOND_2_2_ALT": "Esse ferrão foi forjado a partir de um Minério Pálido puro. Ela veio da Coroa do Reino, onde poucos já se aventuraram antes.",
      "RR_DRYYA_SECOND_2_3": "Sou grata por ter conseguido obter tão facilmente o minério pelo qual a maioria dos ferreiros estão competindo. O meu era apenas um pedaço, trazido dos picos do reino. A mineração deles mal foi feita, então tenho certeza que algum viajante ficaria feliz em descobrir o resto.",
      "RR_DRYYA_SECOND_2_3_ALT": "Sou grata por ter conseguido obter tão facilmente um minério pelo qual a maioria dos ferreiros disputa. Havia mais minério escondido na pedra do pico, então talvez ele possa ser útil para sua velha lâmina.",
      "RR_DRYYA_SECOND_REPEAT": "Ficarei de guarda por enquanto, então. Tenho certeza de que os outros têm muito a dizer para você.",
      "RR_DRYYA_SECOND_DREAM": "Seu ferrão emana uma aura real... Certamente um Forjador de Ferrões deve ter participado de sua criação...",
      "RR_DRYYA_THIRD_1_1": "Parece que finalmente encontrei um adversário à altura em uma batalha de ferrões. Minha oferta de afiar o seu ferrão pode nem ser necessária se você continuar a manuseá-la com tanta destreza.",
      "RR_DRYYA_THIRD_1_2": "Espero vê-lo na arena em breve.",
      "RR_DRYYA_THIRD_REPEAT": "Espero vê-lo na arena em breve.",
      "RR_DRYYA_THIRD_DREAM": "Minha rainha se preocupa... mas talvez ele possa enfrentar a infecção ileso?",
      "RR_DRYYA_CHARM_1": "Notei suas implacáveis sequências de golpes no confronto. Nosso longo treinamento parece ter sido proveitoso e o levou a uma vitória rápida.",
      "RR_DRYYA_CHARM_2": "Você dominou a técnica a ponto de torná-la sua. Devo elogiá-lo por isso.",
      "RR_DRYYA_CHARM_3": "Lembre-se: Nunca se afaste do inimigo depois de alcançá-lo; se você não der uma pausa, ele não conseguirá revidar.",
      "RR_DRYYA_OLDNAIL_1": "...Devo ficar ofendida ou impressionada, que você conseguiu me vencer com um ferrão tão desgastado? Nunca vi um instrumento em tão mau estado.",
      "RR_DRYYA_OLDNAIL_2": "Tal arma não é condizente com alguém da linhagem real. Falarei com o rei sobre como encontrar um ferrão adequado para você; um que não parece que vai quebrar em pedaços com o próximo golpe.",
      "RR_DRYYA_OLDNAIL_3": "Enquanto isso, talvez eu deva aprimorar minhas próprias habilidades...",
      "RR_DRYYA_CHEATER": "Desapareça! Não toleramos trapaceiros ou editores de arquivos aqui. Isso, ou você está usando o NPC.",
      "RR_HEGEMOL_FIRST_1_1": "...Eu nunca imaginaria que um inseto tão pequeno pudesse ter uma força tão poderosa quanto a sua. Você me surpreendeu, pequenino.",
      "RR_HEGEMOL_FIRST_1_2": "Quando o vi pela primeira vez, pensei que seria capaz de derrubá-lo com minha poderosa clava como um Ferreiro golpeia a bigorna, mas não poderia ter ficado mais agradavelmente surpreso.",
      "RR_HEGEMOL_FIRST_1_3": "Isso me faz lembrar de uma vez em que eu estava treinando com Isma, pronto para atacar a vegetação que ela havia criado... Ela invocou uma videira que me fez tropeçar e, desde então, nunca mais me esqueci disso.",
      "RR_HEGEMOL_FIRST_2_1": "Admiro sua habilidade com esse ferrão. Eu nunca seria tão delicado a ponto de manusear um sem o quebrar.",
      "RR_HEGEMOL_FIRST_2_2": "Se eu tivesse que empunhar uma arma semelhante, seria a de Ze'mer. Imagine a habilidade dos ferreiros de sua terra natal para produzir uma lâmina tão imponente além de refinada...",
      "RR_HEGEMOL_FIRST_2_3": "É claro que nada poderia me servir melhor do que minha fiel Maça. Não há necessidade de ser preciso se sua posição não exigir isso, e não há nada como a alegria de esmagar tudo em seu caminho.",
      "RR_HEGEMOL_FIRST_2_4": "Se eu não fosse um Cavaleiro, talvez fosse um bom golem de mineração, oho!",
      "RR_HEGEMOL_FIRST_REPEAT": "Suponho que você verá minha Clava novamente em breve no campo de batalha.",
      "RR_HEGEMOL_FIRST_DREAM": "Minha brincadeira gera apenas um silêncio... você é um cavaleiro estranho...",
      "RR_HEGEMOL_SECOND_1_1": "Estou muito impressionado; Você resistiu a toda a minha força e viveu para contar a história duas vezes agora. Frequentemente sou chamado de \"Poderoso.\" Hegemol, mas talvez eu deva passar esse título para você.",
      "RR_HEGEMOL_SECOND_1_2": "...Ho, estou apenas brincando. Os títulos são reservados para nós, Cavaleiros, embora eu tenha certeza de que você é mais do que capaz de se juntar às nossas fileiras. Treine conosco por mais algum tempo e o Rei, sem dúvida, lhe concederá esse privilégio.",
      "RR_HEGEMOL_SECOND_1_3": "...Claro, claro, eu sei. Você tem outro papel a cumprir. Mas ainda temos um tempo até que você esteja pronto para assumir essa tarefa. Eu adoraria lutar ao seu lado, algum dia, em um combate real.",
      "RR_HEGEMOL_SECOND_1_4": "Acredito que a Batalha de Blackwyrm e o Cerco de Steelcrest teriam terminado muito antes se você estivesse lá, conosco!",
      "RR_HEGEMOL_SECOND_2_1": "Se você ficar maior, deve experimentar uma arma mais pesada, como uma maça ou uma semelhante a de Ze'mer. Pode não ser o que você está acostumado a usar, mas é capaz de desferir golpes muito mais poderosos do que um ferrão. Não diga a Dryya que eu disse isso.",
      "RR_HEGEMOL_SECOND_2_2": "Ah, a arma preferida de Ogrim... Ela com certeza já deixou mais de um inconsciente antes mesmo de atingi-lo! Ho ho ho! Isma é uma bela planta espinhosa no campo de batalha, mas seus talentos realmente florescem quando ajuda os outros.",
      "RR_HEGEMOL_SECOND_2_3": "Nós, Cavaleiros, temos métodos de luta bastante incomuns, não é mesmo? Embora eu deva tomar cuidado com o que digo antes de começar a brigar conosco, ho ho!",
      "RR_HEGEMOL_SECOND_REPEAT": "Você é um divertido oponente para  lutar, pequeno cavaleiro.",
      "RR_HEGEMOL_SECOND_DREAM": "Seríamos um conjunto estranho de guerreiros se você se juntasse à nossa Ordem...",
      "RR_HEGEMOL_THIRD_1_1": "Realmente, admiro sua força e graça. Já nos encontramos muitas vezes em uma batalha, e muitas vezes eu perdi completamente.",
      "RR_HEGEMOL_THIRD_1_2": "Você mal demonstrou qualquer sinal de fadiga antes e depois de nossa luta! Um feito impressionante de resiliência e determinação que todos aspiram alcançar, mas poucos conseguem.",
      "RR_HEGEMOL_THIRD_REPEAT": "Com certeza verei mais de você, pequenino!",
      "RR_HEGEMOL_THIRD_DREAM": "O que o Rei deve ter feito para produzir essa natureza resiliente...",
      "RR_HEGEMOL_CHARM_1": "Esses feitiços curiosos! O Rei realmente lhe ensinou bem a ser capaz de fazer tais lançamentos, invocando armas eficazes a partir da mera alma.",
      "RR_HEGEMOL_CHARM_2": "Você quase me fez questionar minha frieza em relação à criação de feitiços; No entanto, mantenho meus hábitos, pois prefiro a simplicidade de um belo e forte golpe para punir meus inimigos.",
      "RR_HEGEMOL_CHARM_3": "Embora sejam impressionantes, tenha cuidado com seu uso! Você já viu os efeitos em um ambiente seguro, portanto, evite expor possíveis espectadores a eles.",
      "RR_HEGEMOL_CHEATER": "Desapareça! Não toleramos trapaceiros ou editores de arquivos aqui. Isso, ou você está usando o NPC.",
      "RR_ZEMER_FIRST_1_1": "Ahhhh, Le'mer! O manejo do ferrão de Che não poderia se igualar à sua destreza. Uma força raramente encontrada neste antigo reino.",
      "RR_ZEMER_FIRST_1_2": "Aparos perfeitos, um ataque rápido e Che' havia caído sem perceber. Nem meus companheiros antes de Che' nem a lâmina \"Stout\" de Che' mudaram o resultado merecido e justo.",
      "RR_ZEMER_FIRST_1_3": "Le'mer, tais feitos merecem ser imortalizados em prosa. Permita que Che' narre tal história.",
      "RR_ZEMER_FIRST_2_1": "Uma apresentação no início e uma batalha no final; Esterco e Videira, Espada e Clava, tão próximos todos eles caíram e rapidamente Stout surgiu diante do rosto pálido.",
      "RR_ZEMER_FIRST_2_2": "Che', o último cavaleiro em linha, foi observado com um olhar tão firme quanto a empunhadura, seu ferrão colidindo com a Stout de Che', prometendo uma força incomparável à sua forma pequena.",
      "RR_ZEMER_FIRST_2_3": "Nenhum golpe, tormenta ou investida deteria sua determinação, já que Che', ajoelhado no final, foi encarado com o mesmo olhar destemido.",
      "RR_ZEMER_FIRST_2_4": "Ele venceu para se tornar mais forte. Eles venceram para forjar algo mais forte.",
      "RR_ZEMER_FIRST_REPEAT": "Uma história criada às pressas, mas Che' espera que você tenha gostado mesmo assim.",
      "RR_ZEMER_FIRST_DREAM": "Talvez ele possa desfrutar de uma das histórias de Che' em algum momento...?",
      "RR_ZEMER_SECOND_1_1": "Le'mer, a flor de che' desperta sua curiosidade? Para muitos antes, pétalas de pureza únicas, ao contrário de qualquer outra nos ramos da Rainha.",
      "RR_ZEMER_SECOND_1_2": "Nahlo, Nahlo, nenhum outro poderia se igualar a esta, cultivada apenas na terra natal de Che'. Seu caule possui uma delicadeza única, pouco é necessário para manter sua forma.",
      "RR_ZEMER_SECOND_1_3": "Mas que beleza? Única e rara, uma flor de valor extremo, merecedora de cuidado meticuloso e carregando um significado muito querido.",
      "RR_ZEMER_SECOND_1_4": "E de tantas flores em Seus jardins, as raízes relutantes da Rainha se voltam para as pétalas de Che', sem questionar. Che' se pergunta por que, che' estremece ao viver sem mais essa beleza, moina?",
      "RR_ZEMER_SECOND_2_1": "Me'hon, uma história para contar. Uma de amor, aquela pela qual o coração sofre.",
      "RR_ZEMER_SECOND_2_2": "Um louva-a-deus, da grande tribo envolta em esporos. Che' estava apenas acompanhando o rei quando o viu de relance, mas aquele momento efêmero foi suficiente.",
      "RR_ZEMER_SECOND_2_3": "Meua'mor, che' mas deseja ver tal beleza, tal graça mais uma vez. Nahlo, che' deve.",
      "RR_ZEMER_SECOND_REPEAT": "Che' espera vê-la novamente em breve...",
      "RR_ZEMER_SECOND_DREAM": "Ninguém poderia se igualar a ela...",
      "RR_ZEMER_THIRD_1_1": "O ciclo continua, confirmando que você é digno. Wai, Che' deseja que seja um duelo amigável e não um sermão urgente.",
      "RR_ZEMER_THIRD_1_2": "Mas um mundo perigoso espera que lutemos pela vida. Enquanto Che' puder usar suas habilidades para proteger Meua'mor, o combate continuará sendo parte da vida de Che'.",
      "RR_ZEMER_THIRD_1_3": "Le'mer apreciaria algumas lições de Che', moina?",
      "RR_ZEMER_THIRD_REPEAT": "A força é um dom que nem todos possuem. Che' pode te ajudar a treiná-la.",
      "RR_ZEMER_THIRD_DREAM": "Poderia acabar com a ruína que a luz ameaça trazer...?",
      "RR_ZEMER_CHARM_1": "...Ah, a prática do feitiço lhe serviu bem como Che' viu; você se concentrou como nosso Monarca lhe instruiu, a alma repelindo o agressor em perfeita fluidez.",
      "RR_ZEMER_CHARM_2": "No entanto, Che' pôde sentir um grito silencioso em seu uso, uma inquietação ao se concentrar. Será que é por causa de deveres assustadores, saudade de casa...?",
      "RR_ZEMER_CHARM_3": "...Ah, peço desculpas por estar divagando. Me'hon, espero que Le'mer possa usá-lo para o bem. Use-o com muita sabedoria.",
      "RR_ZEMER_CHEATER": "Desapareça! Não toleramos trapaceiros ou editores de arquivos aqui. Isso, ou você está usando o NPC."

Ваш запах гораздо слышнее, когда вы вместе.<page>Преданность и доброта: драгоценные качества, забытые в эти тягостные времена. Вы, конечно, видели их на своем пути - неухоженные шипы и ослепленные чумой безумцы. Не поэтому ли вы оба так молчаливо смотрите на меня? Изма, ты, несомненно, понимаешь изможденное состояние природы в таких условиях, лишь усугубляемое ответственностью и сожалением.<page>Ваше присутствие приятно облегчает мое увядающее тело, и навевает дорогие воспоминания о столь далеком времени. Я благодарна вам за ваш визит.",
      "WL_KH_2": "Как решите отправиться дальше в путь - уважьте мою просьбу, и попрощайтесь с Дрийей, если вы еще не сделали этого.<page>Сколь неодобрительными бы ни были ее слова о тебе, Изма, она все же сердчайше дорожит вами обоими, как и остальными Рыцарями. Я уверена, Огрим это понимает.",

Ты победоносна и зорка как всегда, так ведь, Дрийя?<page>Ты славно держалась, мой рыцарь, так славно. Переведи дух, посиди здесь чуток; я позабочусь обо всем прочем, если нужно.",
      "WL_MP_2": "Я бы хотела, чтобы ты осталась здесь, но я не могу задерживать тебя против твоей же воли. Поступай так, как считаешь нужным, я не осужу тебя. И считай, что это убежище может быть и твоим.<page>Пусть твой ум будет остр, а гвоздь стремителен. Береги себя.",

И нет сил у меня предотвратить ее распространение.<page>Я признательна, что ты пришел сюда, в место, с которым я себя связала. Твоего присутствия мне не хватало, как бы ни был тих твой голос здесь.<page>Я вверяю тебе горожан и их будущее. Храни город в безопасности под своей сенью. Делай, что должен.",

Ее могила, должно быть, хорошо ухожена.<page>Что привело тебя в это пристанище? Ты, несомненно, видела поле битвы над нами, тела, сгрудившиеся в кустах.<page>...Ничто из того, что у меня есть, не может смягчить твою горькую утрату, но я не отвергну волю твою, ежели ты пожелаешь провести здесь немного времени.",
      "WL_VL_2": "Я признательна за твое присутствие, пусть и краткосрочное; такую встречу никто бы не мог предвидеть.<page>Дрийя по-прежнему стоит у входа, так что врагов на пути отсюда не будет. В садах, однако, не теряй бдительности.",
      "WL_ALL_1": "...Это явь? Или все же сон? Гостей так много, но кругом царит пустота. Может быть, мои ростки обманывают мое видение этого места? Или вы все всегда были такими малыми?<page>Прошу, поймите мои сомнения, дорогая Пятерка: я вижу иначе, другими органами чувств, и в эти тяжелые времена я бы никогда не предугадала встречу Великих Рыцарей. Если бы не ваш слабый след, который я ощущаю, я бы сочла свой разум полностью угасшим.<page>Ваш визит навевает отрадные воспоминания о более счастливых временах, от легендарных сказаний до обычных дозоров... Наверняка вы скучаете по тем дням, как и любой выживший ныне. Я тоже тоскую по ним.<page>Тем не менее, в вашей немоте приятно осознавать, что вы следуете своим обязанностям в столь суровых обстоятельствах. Это королевство с благодарностью и уважением встречает таких защитников, как вы.",
      "WL_ALL_2": "Ваше безмолвие вызвано моим присутствием? Знайте, что никакие обязанности не заставляют вас оставаться, ибо у меня нет титула боле.

      "RR_ISMA_SECOND_2_2": "У них есть какая-то неописуемая аура, которая неким образом влияет на Зе'мэр. Может быть, в этом причина... нет, не отвращения, скорее... осмотрительности Королевы?",

      "RR_DRYYA_FIRST_1_2": "Я приложила все усилия, чтобы оставаться начеку с тех пор, как до нас дошли новости об этом... заражении. Хотя долг рыцаря - защищать граждан королевства,- это оказалось непросто, особенно против опасности, которую ни увидеть, ни почувствовать невозможно.",
      "RR_DRYYA_FIRST_1_3": "Зараженные жуки нападают на других, не сдерживаясь, даже на тех, с кем они близки. У многих просто не хватает сил обратить свой гвоздь против них.",
      "RR_DRYYA_FIRST_1_4": "Но, думаю, тебе не стоит беспокоиться об этом, поскольку Король поведал нам о пустоте, присущей лишь тебе, которая защищает тебя от воздействия этой чумы.",
      "RR_DRYYA_FIRST_2_1": "Твои боевые навыки превосходны. Я давно не переживала такого восторга от поединка на гвоздях. Хотя Хегемол хвастается своими размерами и ударами, его габариты делают его уязвимым. Только не говори ему, что я это сказала.",
      "RR_DRYYA_FIRST_2_2": "Изма скорее полагается на свою стремительность, разбрасывая повсюду свои растения, отвлекая врагов, прежде чем нанести удар самой. Огрим тоже, похоже, подражает ее приемам с помощью своих... снарядов.",
      "RR_DRYYA_FIRST_2_3": "Мой стиль больше всего совпадает с твоим, и все же я никак не могла нанести тебе решительный удар. Ты, несомненно, серьезный соперник, по силе не уступающий ни мне, ни Зе'мэр.",
      "RR_DRYYA_FIRST_2_4": "Быть может, однажды ты превзойдешь всех нас. Или пока рано говорить об этом?",

      "RR_DRYYA_FIRST_DREAM": "Любовь, забота... Разве можно без них спасти наше драгоценное королевство?",
      "RR_DRYYA_SECOND_1_1": "Твоему выверенному стилю можно только позавидовать, для такого букашки ты очень грозен. И показать такие навыки не один раз, а два...",
      "RR_DRYYA_SECOND_1_2": "Было бы интересно узнать, что будет, когда ты подрастешь? Жаль будет, если с возрастом ты потеряешь такую ловкость, пусть это и ожидаемо...",
      "RR_DRYYA_SECOND_1_3": "Может Зе'мэр могла бы научить тебя, как она так юрко движется, несмотря на свой рост. Никто из нас не смог достичь ее высот, но с тобой все иначе...",
      "RR_DRYYA_SECOND_2_1": "Заточка гвоздя - это целое искусство, знаешь ли. Если тебе когда-нибудь понадобится отполировать свое оружие - я с радостью помогу.",
      "RR_DRYYA_SECOND_2_2": "Похоже, твой гвоздь тоже был выкован из Бледной Руды. Моя - с Венца Королевства, куда мало кто раньше ступал.",
      "RR_DRYYA_SECOND_2_2_ALT": "Сей гвоздь в моих руках был выкован из чистейшей Бледной Руды. Ее добыли с Венца Королевства, куда мало кто раньше ступал.",
      "RR_DRYYA_SECOND_2_3": "Я признательна, что мне так легко удалось добыть руду, на которую претендует большинство кузнецов. Моя была всего лишь небольшим куском, привезенным с королевских пиков. Их рудник едва ли исчерпан, так что я уверена , что какой-нибудь путешественник будет рад обнаружить остальное.",
      "RR_DRYYA_SECOND_2_3_ALT": "Я признательна, что мне так легко удалось достать руду, ради который кузнецы готовы беспрестанно ругаться друг с другом. В глыбе на пике есть еще, быть может ты найдешь ей применение для своего старого клинка.",

      "RR_DRYYA_SECOND_DREAM": "От его гвоздя исходит благородная аура... В его создании, несомненно, принимал участие мастер гвоздильного дела...",
      "RR_DRYYA_THIRD_1_1": "Похоже, я встретила себе равного в бою гвоздей. Предложение заточить свой гвоздь может даже не понадобиться, если ты и дальше будешь обращаться с ним столь ловко.",
      "RR_DRYYA_THIRD_1_2": "Думаю, скоро мы увидимся на арене.",
      "RR_DRYYA_THIRD_REPEAT": "Думаю, скоро мы увидимся на арене.",
      "RR_DRYYA_THIRD_DREAM": "Моей Королеве тревожно... но, возможно, оно сможет благополучно побороть заражение?",
      "RR_DRYYA_CHARM_1": "Я обратила внимание на твои неустанные замахи в бою. Похоже, наши долгие тренировки принесли свои плоды и скорую победу.",
      "RR_DRYYA_CHARM_2": "Ты овладел этой техникой до такой степени, что она стала твоей собственной. Мне следует похвалить тебя за это!",
      "RR_DRYYA_CHARM_3": "Запомни: никогда не выпускай врага из рук, как только ты его настиг. Не дашь ему передышку - тогда он и отбиваться не сможет.",
      "RR_DRYYA_OLDNAIL_1": "...Мне обидеться или впечатлиться тем, что ты превзошел меня с таким изношенным гвоздем? Ни в жизнь не видела инструмент в таком плачевном состоянии.",
      "RR_DRYYA_OLDNAIL_2": "Подобное оружие не подобает королевскому роду. Я поговорю с Королем о том, чтобы найти тебе подходящий гвоздь. Желательно такой, который не выглядит готовым рассыпаться на куски при следующем ударе.",
      "RR_DRYYA_OLDNAIL_3": "А пока, пожалуй, я отточу свои собственные навыки...",
      "RR_DRYYA_CHEATER": "Сгинь! Мы не терпим шулеров и редакторов сохранений в этих местах. Ну, или же ты используешь НПС-образец.",
      "RR_HEGEMOL_FIRST_1_1": "Никогда бы не подумал, что такая букашка может обладать такой мощью, как у тебя. Удивил ты меня, малой.",
      "RR_HEGEMOL_FIRST_1_2": "При первой встрече я думал, что смогу поразить тебя своей могучей булавой, как кузнец гвоздей бьет по наковальне, но ты меня приятно удивил.",
      "RR_HEGEMOL_FIRST_1_3": "Это напоминает мне о том случае, во время одной из тренировок с Измой... Я был готов прорваться сквозь листву, которую она создала... Тогда она притянула к себе лозу, о которую я тут же споткнулся. С тех пор она никогда не давала мне об этом забыть.",
      "RR_HEGEMOL_FIRST_2_1": "Я действительно восхищаюсь твоим мастерством обращения с гвоздем. Я бы никогда не смог справиться со столь деликатным инструментом, не сломав его.",
      "RR_HEGEMOL_FIRST_2_2": "Будь у меня похожее оружие, это было бы оружие Зе'мэр. Какими должны быть кузнецы ее родины, чтобы сотворить такой массивный, но изысканный клинок...",
      "RR_HEGEMOL_FIRST_2_3": "Но, все же, ничто не подходит мне больше моей верной булавы. Незачем быть аккуратным, если твоя должность не требует этого, да и нет большей радости, чем радость от крушения всего на своем пути.",
      "RR_HEGEMOL_FIRST_2_4": "Не будь я рыцарем, возможно, из меня получился бы хороший шахтерский голем, о-хо!",
      "RR_HEGEMOL_FIRST_REPEAT": "Думаю, скоро ты снова увидишь мою булаву на поле битвы.",
      "RR_HEGEMOL_FIRST_DREAM": "А на мою шутку в ответ лишь тишина... Странный ты, маленький рыцарь...",
      "RR_HEGEMOL_SECOND_1_1": "Я глубоко впечатлен; ты выдержал мою мощь и дважды остался жив. Меня часто зовут .\"Могучим.\" Хегемолом, но быть может этот титул пора передать тебе.",
      "RR_HEGEMOL_SECOND_1_2": "...Ха, я лишь шучу. Такие титулы предназначены только для нас, рыцарей, хотя я уверен, что ты более чем способен пополнить наши ряды. Потренируйся с нами еще чуть-чуть, и Король, несомненно, окажет тебе эту честь.",
      "RR_HEGEMOL_SECOND_1_3": "...Конечно, разумеется, я знаю. У тебя есть другая роль, которую нужно исполнить. Но у нас есть какое-то время, прежде чем ты примешься за то дело. Я бы очень хотел однажды сразиться с тобой бок о бок, в настоящем пылу битвы.",
      "RR_HEGEMOL_SECOND_1_4": "Вполне возможно, что Битва Черночерва и Осада Сталькреста закончились бы гораздо быстрее, будь ты с нами!",
      "RR_HEGEMOL_SECOND_2_1": "Если ты когда-нибудь подрастешь, тебе стоит попробовать более массивное оружие. Например булаву! Или что-то вроде того, что избрала Зе'мэр. Пусть это не то, к чему ты привык, но им можно наносить гораздо более мощные удары, чем гвоздем. Э-э... Не говори Дрийе, что я это сказал.",
      "RR_HEGEMOL_SECOND_2_2": "О, а любимое оружие Огрима... Оно уж точно многих вырубило до потери сознания еще до первого удара! Хо-хо! Изма - та еще тернистая лоза на поле боя, но ее талант по-настоящему расцветает, когда она помогает другим.",
      "RR_HEGEMOL_SECOND_2_3": "У нас, Рыцарей, довольно необычные методы борьбы, не находишь? Хотя мне надо бы быть осторожнее в словах, пока мы не разругались, хо-хо!",
      "RR_HEGEMOL_SECOND_REPEAT": "Сражаться с тобой - одна радость, маленький рыцарь.",
      "RR_HEGEMOL_SECOND_DREAM": "Странными воинами мы бы были, вступи оно в наши ряды...",
      "RR_HEGEMOL_THIRD_1_1": "Воистину, твоей силой и грацией можно только восхищаться. Уж много раз мы встречались в бою, и много раз я основательно проигрывал.",
      "RR_HEGEMOL_THIRD_1_2": "Ты даже не показываешь ни малейшего следа усталости! Впечатляющий подвиг выдержки и решимости, к которому стремятся все, но мало кто достигает.",
      "RR_HEGEMOL_THIRD_REPEAT": "Я обязательно еще увижу тебя, малой!",
      "RR_HEGEMOL_THIRD_DREAM": "Что же сделал Король, чтобы создать такую упорную сущность...",
      "RR_HEGEMOL_CHARM_1": "Какие диковинные заклинания! Король и правда хорошо обучил тебя, раз ты способен создавать готовое оружие одной лишь душой.",
      "RR_HEGEMOL_CHARM_2": "Обычно к заклинаниями я безразличен, но ты на мгновение заставил меня усомниться! И все же, я останусь при своем мнении. Я предпочитаю простоту хорошего, увесистого взмаха, чтобы покарать своих врагов.",
      "RR_HEGEMOL_CHARM_3": "И хотя они впечатляют, будь осторожен в их использовании! Ты видел их силу в безопасной обстановке, так что не подвергай опасности случайных прохожих.",
      "RR_HEGEMOL_CHEATER": "Сгинь! Мы не терпим шулеров и редакторов сохранений в этих местах. Ну, или же ты используешь НПС-образец.",
      "RR_ZEMER_FIRST_1_1": "Ах-х-х, Ле'мэр! Та гвоздем сыграла, на славу, да. Но не чета Ле'мэр и таланту твоему. Сила, виданная редко в королевстве старом.",
      "RR_ZEMER_FIRST_1_2": "Идеальное парирование, резвые удары, и вот та пала, прежде чем узнала. Ни содруги пред та, ни мо'клинок \"Решимость\" не изменили сей исход... Воистину заслужен.",
      "RR_ZEMER_FIRST_1_3": "Ле'мэр, ах подвиги твои бессмертия заслуживают в прозе. Позволь былину мне сплести.",

      "RR_OGRIM_SECOND_2_2": "伊思玛告诉过我，她也想在自己的居所里开辟一片花园。不知那些植物能否在皇家水道的微光之下生存？",

      "RR_ISMA_SECOND_1_2": "在我们偏好的环境之下，战斗也变得更有趣了，不是吗？幸好，我们的王给大家留出了专用的空间来切磋实力。",
      "RR_ISMA_SECOND_1_3": "粪土、荆棘、花朵……比起单调的纯白色，这不是更令人赏心悦目吗？不知何故，我们的国王并不介意这股臭味！",
      "RR_ISMA_SECOND_2_1": "泽莫尔加入战斗的时候，你有没有注意到那些白色的花朵？如此脆弱，长势却又如此之快，印象中，我还不曾见过这样的植物。",
      "RR_ISMA_SECOND_2_2": "泽莫尔身上有着一层光环，它似乎会以某种形式影响着她，我也解释不清楚。或许这就是王后那么…….不，不是厌恶，而是……谨慎的原因？",
      "RR_ISMA_SECOND_2_3": "不管怎么说，看着绿植在战场上生长总是件快乐的事情。",
      "RR_ISMA_SECOND_REPEAT": "就让我们在战斗中再会吧！",

      "RR_ISMA_CHARM_3": "请好好保管那枚胸针，它同样也是我的珍视之物。希望它能助你一臂之力！",

      "RR_DRYYA_FIRST_1_1": "噢，是你啊。进来吧。",
      "RR_DRYYA_FIRST_1_2": "自从……感染的消息传开以后，我便一直在努力保持警惕。守护王国的臣民是骑士的职责，但这真的很难，尤其是眼下，我们正面临着一场看不见、摸不着的危机。",
      "RR_DRYYA_FIRST_1_3": "染病的虫子会大肆攻击他人，哪怕是它们身边的熟人也不例外。很多虫子都无法下定决心把骨钉对准感染者。",
      "RR_DRYYA_FIRST_1_4": "可我想你不必担心这件事吧。国王告诉过我们，你的体内拥有一种空虚之物，能让你免于瘟疫的影响。",
      "RR_DRYYA_FIRST_2_1": "你的战斗本领相当出众，我已经很久没有在骨钉战中感到如此兴奋过了。别看海格默总是夸耀他的体格、吹嘘他的重击，那副笨重的身形可是他的一大弱点。可不要告诉他我说过这句话啊。",
      "RR_DRYYA_FIRST_2_2": "伊思玛宁肯靠着自己灵巧的身形，四处播撒植物来分散敌人的注意力，也不愿主动出击。奥格瑞姆也一样，就像是在用自己的……投射物去模仿她似的。",
      "RR_DRYYA_FIRST_2_3": "我的战斗方式与你最为相近，可我却找不到你身上的破绽，打不出致命一击。你确实是个强劲的对手，实力与我和泽莫尔不相上下。",
      "RR_DRYYA_FIRST_2_4": "或许有一天，你会超越我们所有人。现在下定论是否为时尚早？",
      "RR_DRYYA_FIRST_REPEAT": "我该去专心履行自己的职责了。或许我们可以换个时间再谈。",
      "RR_DRYYA_FIRST_DREAM": "博爱，关怀……难道我们不需要用这些品质来拯救王国吗？",
      "RR_DRYYA_SECOND_1_1": "对于一只小虫子而言，你那全能的本领既让人生羡，也让人生畏。何况你不止办到了一次，而是两次……",
      "RR_DRYYA_SECOND_1_2": "我很想知道，等你体型成长之后，又会变成什么样？要是你的行动能力随着年龄增长而下降，那就太可惜了，但现实多半会是如此吧……",
      "RR_DRYYA_SECOND_1_3": "别看泽莫尔是那副身形，或许她能把自己迅速行动的本领传授给你呢。我们谁都学不到精髓，但你似乎与众不同……",
      "RR_DRYYA_SECOND_2_1": "骨钉强化是一门艺术。要是哪天你想打磨自己的武器了，我很乐意帮忙。",
      "RR_DRYYA_SECOND_2_2": ":看起来，你的骨钉也是由苍白矿石锻造而成的。我的那块来自于圣巢之冠，以前没什么人敢去那里冒险。",
      "RR_DRYYA_SECOND_2_2_ALT": "我的骨钉是由苍白矿石锻造而成的。那块矿石来自于圣巢之冠，以前没什么人敢去那里冒险。",
      "RR_DRYYA_SECOND_2_3": "能轻松获得多数钉子匠趋之若鹜的苍白矿石，我始终心存感激。我的那一块，只不过是从王国顶峰带回来的而已。矿石的开采工作还远远没有结束，我相信肯定会有旅行者乐于去发掘剩余的那些吧。",
      "RR_DRYYA_SECOND_2_3_ALT": "能轻松获得多数钉子匠争来抢去的苍白矿石，我始终心存感激。顶峰的山岩上还有更多矿石，或许你也能用它来强化自己的旧骨钉。",
      "RR_DRYYA_SECOND_REPEAT": "那么，我会继续保持警惕的。我相信其他人也有很多话想对你说。",
      "RR_DRYYA_SECOND_DREAM": "它的骨钉散发着王室的气场……背后肯定有着某位大师钉子匠的功劳……",
      "RR_DRYYA_THIRD_1_1": "看来我终于在骨钉战中遇到了对手。要是你能继续像这样灵敏地战斗下去，或许我都不必再为你强化骨钉了。",
      "RR_DRYYA_THIRD_1_2": "我想我很快就会与你在战场上再见。",
      "RR_DRYYA_THIRD_REPEAT": "我想我很快就会与你在战场上再见。",
      "RR_DRYYA_THIRD_DREAM": "我的王后很担心……但或许它能安然无恙地应对感染？",
      "RR_DRYYA_CHARM_1": "你在试炼中横挥竖劈的坚韧表现，我全都看在了眼里。看来我们的长期训练颇具成效，你也胜得干脆利落。",
      "RR_DRYYA_CHARM_2": "你已经熟练到能够把这项技巧化为己用了。为此，我可得表扬你一番。",
      "RR_DRYYA_CHARM_3": "千万记住，一旦接触到了敌人，就别再放过对方了。只要你不给他们喘息的机会，他们就无法反击。",
      "RR_DRYYA_OLDNAIL_1": "……你用这么陈旧的骨钉战胜了我，我是该感到生气呢，还是该对你刮目相看呢？我从未见过有哪件武器破损得这么厉害。",

      "RR_HEGEMOL_FIRST_1_2": "第一眼看到你的时候，我还以为自己能像钉子匠捶打砧板一般，用我那强劲的巨锤击倒你，可结果却让我无比惊喜。",
      "RR_HEGEMOL_FIRST_1_3": "这让我想起过去和伊思玛的一次切磋，正当我准备冲破她创造的枝叶时……她却召唤出一条藤蔓将我绊倒。自那之后，她便一直把这件事挂在嘴边。",
      "RR_HEGEMOL_FIRST_2_1": "我确实很欣赏你挥舞骨钉的本领。我可没有你那么细腻，换做是我，估计迟早都会折断它吧。",
      "RR_HEGEMOL_FIRST_2_2": "要是让我来挑一件同类的武器，那我一定会选泽莫尔的。如此巨大，却又如此精致，真不明白她故乡的武器匠们是怎么做到的……",
      "RR_HEGEMOL_FIRST_2_3": "当然了，这把可靠的巨锤才是最适合我的，反正我也不需要去精确打击战场上的敌人。粉碎面前的一切障碍才是最快乐的事，没有什么能与之相比！",
      "RR_HEGEMOL_FIRST_2_4": "要是我没有成为骑士的话，或许还挺适合去当一台无情的挖矿魔像呢，哦嚯！",
      "RR_HEGEMOL_FIRST_REPEAT": "估计要不了多久，我的巨锤就会在战场上与你再会了。",
      "RR_HEGEMOL_FIRST_DREAM": "我的玩笑只换回了一片寂静……你确实是一位奇怪的小骑士啊……",
      "RR_HEGEMOL_SECOND_1_1": "我太佩服你了。你经受住了我的全力，而且还成功了两次。我常被称作“强大的”海格默，但也许我该把这个头衔转让给你了。",
      "RR_HEGEMOL_SECOND_1_2": "……嚯，我只是在说笑。只有骑士们才能拥有头衔，不过我敢肯定，你完全有能力加入我们的行列。再和我们多训练一段时间吧，国王一定会赐予你这份荣誉的。",
      "RR_HEGEMOL_SECOND_1_3": "……没错，没错，我知道的。你身上还肩负着别的责任。不过，在你准备好承担那项任务之前，我们手头还有一些时间。日后若有实战的机会，我也愿意与你并肩作战。",
      "RR_HEGEMOL_SECOND_1_4": "我相信，当初你要是能与我们为伍的话，黑沃姆之战与钢铁纹章之围都会早早结束的！",
      "RR_HEGEMOL_SECOND_2_1": "要是你以后还会长个子，那你一定要试一次重型武器，可以是巨锤，也可以是泽莫尔用的那种。或许你会觉得不太习惯，但它那一记重击砸下去，力道可比骨钉大多了。呃，别告诉我德莱娅这话是我说的啊。",
      "RR_HEGEMOL_SECOND_2_2": "噢，还有奥格瑞姆选的武器……怕不是在砸中目标之前，就能让敌人晕过去了！嚯嚯！至于伊思玛嘛，战场上的她就如同带刺的荆棘一般，但在帮助他人的时候，她的天赋才得以真正绽放。",
      "RR_HEGEMOL_SECOND_2_3": "我们骑士的战斗方式还挺不一般的，没错吧？不过我说话还是得小心点，省得让大家拌起嘴来，嚯嚯！",
      "RR_HEGEMOL_SECOND_REPEAT": "与你作战真是快乐啊，小骑士。",
      "RR_HEGEMOL_SECOND_DREAM": "如果它也加入我们的行列，那我们将是多么奇特的一群战士啊……",
      "RR_HEGEMOL_THIRD_1_1": "真的，我很佩服你的力量与优雅。我们已在战斗中相会了许多次，我也完败了许多次。",
      "RR_HEGEMOL_THIRD_1_2": "你几乎就没露出过疲倦的样子！人人都想拥有这样的坚毅与决心，却只有少数人能真正达到这种境界。",
      "RR_HEGEMOL_THIRD_REPEAT": "我们之后一定还会再见很多次吧，小骑士！",
      "RR_HEGEMOL_THIRD_DREAM": "国王究竟做了什么，才练就出如此坚毅的性格……",
      "RR_HEGEMOL_CHARM_1": "是那些古怪的法术！你能掌握这些本领，将区区灵魂转化成强效的武器，看来国王确实是教导有方啊。",
      "RR_HEGEMOL_CHARM_2": "你差点就动摇了我对法术研究一贯的冷漠态度。但我还是要坚持自己的方式。我更欣赏重型武器的简洁感，也更喜欢用帅气的重击来击溃敌人。",
      "RR_HEGEMOL_CHARM_3": "法术是很了不起，但还是要谨慎使用啊！你已经在别的地方见识过法术的威力了，所以千万要小心，可别伤到周围的旁观者们。",
      "RR_HEGEMOL_CHEATER": "退下！我们不能容忍使用作弊器或存档修改器进入此地之人，除非你是一位内测人员。",
      "RR_ZEMER_FIRST_1_1": "啊啊，瞧瞧你！我的钉法还是比不上你的实力呀。在这古老的王国之中，你这样的本领难得一见。",
      "RR_ZEMER_FIRST_1_2": "完美招架，迅速进攻，不知不觉间，我已败下阵来。你赢得很漂亮，无论是在我之前的几位战友们，还是我的利刃“不屈”，都无法扭转这一结局。",
      "RR_ZEMER_FIRST_1_3": "你的事迹该被记录下来，永世流传。就让我来为你编织一段佳话吧。",
      "RR_ZEMER_FIRST_2_1": "授课以始，试炼以终。粪土与藤蔓，骨钉和巨锤，不多时便接连落败。转眼间，“不屈”已现身于苍白的面庞之前。",
      "RR_ZEMER_FIRST_2_2": "我是试炼中最后的骑士。它昂首看向我，视线紧锁，一如紧握手中的武器；它的骨钉也与我的“不屈”针锋相对，小巧的身形释放出巨大的力量。",
      "RR_ZEMER_FIRST_2_3": "任凭横挥竖砍，左冲右撞，都无法阻止它的决心。待我双膝着地之时，它的眼神仍是无所畏惧、坚定不移。",
      "RR_ZEMER_FIRST_2_4": "它练成了更强的体魄，骑士们铸就了更强的勇者。",
      "RR_ZEMER_FIRST_REPEAT": "创作得有些匆忙，还请谅解。无论如何，希望你能喜欢。",
      "RR_ZEMER_FIRST_DREAM": "或许有一天，它还愿意听听我的其他故事……？",
      "RR_ZEMER_SECOND_1_1": "我说你啊，是不是被这绽开的花儿勾起了好奇心？曾有很多人与你一样。它洁白的花瓣别具一格，不同于王后枝条上其他的花朵。",
      "RR_ZEMER_SECOND_1_2": "哎呀哎呀，它只生长在我的家乡，世上的花儿都无法与之媲美。它的花茎也脆弱得很，轻轻一捻，就能揉碎。",
      "RR_ZEMER_SECOND_1_3": "但它多漂亮啊！它美得独一无二，蕴含着深切的意义，且富有极高的价值，应当被精心呵护才是。",
      "RR_ZEMER_SECOND_1_4": "王后的花园中群花绽放，可她却唯独不愿把根脉伸向我的花瓣。她为何如此待我？离了这片动人的美景，我便只能惶惶度日。",
      "RR_ZEMER_SECOND_2_1": "小家伙，我有故事诉说。一段关于爱情的故事，一段让人心痛的故事。",
      "RR_ZEMER_SECOND_2_2": "曾经有一只螳螂，生活在那孢子环绕的部落之中。我不过是在护送国王的途中瞥见了她一眼，怎料片刻却已足够。",
      "RR_ZEMER_SECOND_2_3": "我的爱人，那般美丽，那般优雅，我只希望还能再见上她一面。哎，我一定要再见到她。",
      "RR_ZEMER_SECOND_REPEAT": "但愿我能尽快与她相见……",
      "RR_ZEMER_SECOND_DREAM": "没人能比得过她……",
      "RR_ZEMER_THIRD_1_1": "战斗循环不休，一遍遍地证明着你的实力。哎，与其进行这般急切的说教，我倒更希望能来上一场友好的切磋。",
      "RR_ZEMER_THIRD_1_2": "可眼下，整个世界岌岌可危，我们应当全力抗争。只要我还能用自己的本领来保护吾爱，战斗就将永远是我生命的一部分。",
      "RR_ZEMER_THIRD_1_3": "你会感谢我的教导吗？",
      "RR_ZEMER_THIRD_REPEAT": "力量这种天赋，并不是人人都能拥有。我愿意帮你进行训练。",
      "RR_ZEMER_THIRD_DREAM": "它能终结光芒的威胁吗……？",
      "RR_ZEMER_CHARM_1": "……啊，看来法术练习很有成效。你遵循了王的教诲，聚起了灵魂，以完美的节奏击退了来犯者。",
      "RR_ZEMER_CHARM_2": "可当你集中力量时，我却能从中感受到一种无声的哭喊，感受到一丝不安。是因为这责任沉重得可怕吗？是因为你渴望归宿吗……？",
      "RR_ZEMER_CHARM_3": "……啊，抱歉，是我扯远了。小家伙，我希望你能善用它，也务必要慎用它。",
      "RR_ZEMER_CHEATER": "退下！我们不能容忍使用作弊器或存档修改器进入此地之人，除非你是一位内测人员。"
